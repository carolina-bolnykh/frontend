flexbox: aligning items 
  - justify-content: along main axis
  - align-items: along opposing axis
  - easiest way to center a div is to display: flex in the container and justify & align center
  - vh: 100


grid: best for 2d displays
  - display: grid
  - grid-template-rows: 100px 100px 150px 200px
  - grid-template-cols: repeat(50px, 4)
  - grid-row: span 2
  - grid-column: span 9


bootstrap: premade components
    - relies on a premade 12-column system
    - good for creating responsive websites, has good breakpoints
    - <div class = "col-10"> occupies 10 out of 12 columns
    - <div class = "col-lg-10"> occupies 10 out of 12 columns when we hit the lg mark, this removes the need for media queries
    - if we wanted a row: create a div for container, div for row, and div for each item in the row (each item's class is where the col-10 is applied)
