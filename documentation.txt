flexbox: aligning items 
  - justify-content: along main axis
  - align-items: along opposing axis
  - easiest way to center a div is to display: flex in the container and justify & align center


grid: best for 2d displays


bootstrap: premade components
    - good for creating responsive websites, has good breakpoints
    - <div class = "col-10"> occupies 10 out of 12 columns
    <div class = "col-lg-10"> occupies 10 out of 12 columns when we hit the lg mark, this removes the need for media queries
